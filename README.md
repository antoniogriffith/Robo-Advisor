# Robo-Advisor
A tool to automate the process of providing business clients with stock trading recommendations. The program accepts one or more stock or cryptocurrency symbols as information inputs, then it requests real live historical trading data from the Internet, and finally it provides a recommendation as to whether or not the client should purchase the given stocks or cryptocurrencies.
